# autocomplete_ios

Created this project for fun a few years ago to recreate some functionality I saw in Xcode. Created it to see what would 
be involved in a possible solution. I wrote both the iOS and Android version in about a weekend, and looking back there
are definately some areas that could be modified.

The main piece of the feature can been see in the AutoCompleteMatcher class. I am basically moving through a string and seeing 
if the chars match (in order) the character set passed in. After matching I highlight the matching characters in the string 
and show it in a list.

After a rewrite and a polish I think you could turn this into a nice search text highlighter.
